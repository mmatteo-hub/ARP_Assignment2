########## SHARED MEMORY ##########
In this case, two processes are running, a producer and a consumer, which communicate through a circular buffer in shared memory.
The producer initializes an array of chars of the size decided by the user. 
Dynamic memory allocation was used because arrays larger than 7 Mb were not statically allocated.
Then both the processes do the mapping 4kB of shared memory.
It is used as a circular buffer where the producer writes and in a concurrent way the consumer reads.
These actions are coordinated by 3 semaphores (mutex).
There is also another semaphore that blocks the producer until teh consumer is ready to receive data.
In this way the consumers knows when the producer starts and can evaluated the time passed trasferring data.
