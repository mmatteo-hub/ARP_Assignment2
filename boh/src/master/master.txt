########## MASTER ##########
This process has the purpose of:
- receiving as input from the user the size of data to be transferred
- checking that it is a value between 1 and 100
- running the processes relating to the mode chosen for data transfer
- before quit, kills all the processes

The data can be trasferred by:
1- unnamed pipe
2- named pipe
3- socket
4- shared memory

The master process takes care of creating and destroying the named pipe, randomly chooses a port between 5000 and 5099 for the socket and gives all processes the size received from the user.
