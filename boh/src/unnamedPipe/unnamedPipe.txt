########## UNNAMED PIPE ##########
To transfer data via an unnamed pipe, only one process is performed, which forks. 
The parent process will be the producer and the child process the consumer. 
The producer initializes an array of chars of the size decided by the user. 
In this case, dynamic memory allocation was used because arrays larger than 7 Mb were not statically allocated.
The data is written and read on the pipe in 1kB packets.
