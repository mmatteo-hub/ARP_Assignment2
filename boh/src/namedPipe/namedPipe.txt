########## NAMED PIPE ##########
In this case, two processes are running, a producer and a consumer, which communicate through a named pipe created by the master process.
The producer initializes an array of chars of the size decided by the user. 
In this case, dynamic memory allocation was used because arrays larger than 7 Mb were not statically allocated.
The data is written and read on the pipe in 1kB packets.
